This package contains windows x64 installer for Pencil 2d. The installer works good ("dist/setup.exe"), 
the file "dist/Pencil 2d - Inno Setup Compiler.iss" need to be changed because they have absolutes paths (I marked them with comments /**/). Good luck! Other files are from official Pencil 2d repositiory, I need them to create installer.
